# Visualizing COVID-19 Cases Worldwide
**November 27th, 2020**

Datacamp project to visualize coronavirus cases over time by country.

Please visit the [published version](https://rpubs.com/awalmer/701371) on my [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/awalmer) profile for the complete project.
This exploration is based on a project from DataCamp.com, found here: https://projects.datacamp.com/projects/870. 
The goal here is to explore the trends in COVID-19 cases over time by country. The data is regularly updated, and I pulled an updated version of it on November 27th, 2020. 
Data accessible here: https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/tree/master/csv.
